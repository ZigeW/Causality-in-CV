### A Causal Inference Look At Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection 

https://www.aaai.org/AAAI22Papers/AAAI-37.LinX.pdf

propose a causal graph for VAD task then use backdoor adjustment; model ensemble for temporal context

![1647160664256](https://github.com/ZigeW/Causality-in-CV/raw/main/images/1647160664256.png)

- do(x) can not only intervene the direct parent of x, also the grandparents of x *(?)*
- for temporal context, use sliding window to create counterfactual feature, then add models together as ensembling

### A Causal Debiasing Framework for Unsupervised Salient Object Detection

https://www.aaai.org/AAAI22Papers/AAAI-108.LinX.pdf

observed two distribution biases in USOD task - contrast distribution bias (data-rich v.s. non-rich) and spatial distribution bias (center or not), propose a causal graph then use backdoor adjustment for the former and image-level weighting for the latter

![1647161659989](https://github.com/ZigeW/Causality-in-CV/raw/main/images/1647161659989.png)

- low-level visual appearance feature (from lower layer of backbone network) and high-level semantic feature (from higher layer) are concatenated together

### Causal Intervention for Subject-Deconfounded Facial Action Unit Recognition

https://www.aaai.org/AAAI22Papers/AAAI-399.ChenY.pdf

propose causal diagram and a plug-in causal intervention module (CIS)

![1647173158683](https://github.com/ZigeW/Causality-in-CV/raw/main/images/1647173158683.png)

- CIS - build a fixed dictionary of confounder using the training data which is updated after each epoch; approximate R as a weighted aggregation of all confounders using attention as weights

### Deconfounding Physical Dynamics with Global Causal Relation and Confounder Transmission for Counterfactual Prediction

https://www.aaai.org/AAAI22Papers/AAAI-3051.LiZ.pdf

propose global causal relation attention (GCRA) and confounder transmission structure (CTS)

- GCRA - encode temporal and spatial information by applying interframe attention and intraframe attention
- CTS - construct a causal graph using learned confounder information of GCRA as nodes and contact relations of objects as edges, a do-operation graph with same structure, concatenate two graphs together, then use GNN to propagate node and edge information

### Information-Theoretic Bias Reduction via Causal View of Spurious Correlation

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03121.pdf

propose a structural causal model; use mutual information to measure the co-dependence of bias variables and features

![1647169213011](https://github.com/ZigeW/Causality-in-CV/raw/main/images/1647169213011.png)

- X - input image; C - context prior; Z - bias variable; Y - target label *(target label added in causal graph?)*
- add the mutual information of Z and F conditioned on Y as a loss regularizer

### Debiasing NLU Models via Causal Intervention and Counterfactual Reasoning

causal graph for Natural Language Inference (NLI) task, use *counterfactual reasoning* instead of maximum likelihood to train network

![1647171173445](https://github.com/ZigeW/Causality-in-CV/raw/main/images/1647171173445.png)

- obtain the counterfactual situation (no-treatment condition) by not providing p/c/h

- total effect  = natural direct effect + total indirect effect (M as mediator)
  $$
  TE = Y_{x,M_{x}}-Y_{x*,M_{x*}}
  $$

  $$
  NDE=Y_{x,M_{x*}}-Y_{x*,M_{x*}}
  $$

### VACA: Designing Variational Graph Autoencoders for Causal Queries

https://www.aaai.org/AAAI22Papers/AAAI-12865.SanchezMartinP.pdf

model observational, interventional and counterfactual distribution using variational graph autoencoder

![1647246979948](https://github.com/ZigeW/Causality-in-CV/raw/main/images/1647246979948.png)

- encoder should not have hidden layer 
- decoder should have hidden layers no less than the longest direct path in causal graph - 1

### Deconfounded Visual Grounding

https://www.aaai.org/AAAI22Papers/AAAI-3671.HuangJ.pdf

https://github.com/psanch21/VACA

propose a causal graph; substitute the unobserved confounder with a confounder that can be learned as a dictionary; use simple language attention module to perform deconfouding

![1647248655334](https://github.com/ZigeW/Causality-in-CV/raw/main/images/1647248655334.png)

![1647248671173](https://github.com/ZigeW/Causality-in-CV/raw/main/images/1647248671173.png)

- do-intervention
  $$
  P(L|do(R),X)=E_{\hat{g} \sim \hat{G}}[P(L|R,X,\hat{g})]
  $$
  Normalized Weighted Geometric Mean
  $$
  P(L|do(R),X) \approx P(L|E_{\hat{g} \sim \hat{G}}[R,\hat{g}],X)
  $$

- backdoor adjustment
  $$
  E_{\hat{g} \sim \hat{G}}[R,\hat{g}]=\sum_{\hat{g} \sim \hat{G}}f(r,\hat{g})P(\hat{g})
  $$
  $f$ is feature fusion function (language attention module) and $P(\hat{g})$ is 1/n (n entries in dictionary)

- deconfounded visual grounding
  $$
  P(L=l|do(R=r),X=x) \approx P(l|\sum_{\hat{g}}f(R,\hat{g})P(\hat{g}) \oplus x)=P(l|r' \oplus x)
  $$
